<h2 id="hed2">African American Vernacular English</h2>

<h1> &nbsp;</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most linguists refer to African Americans as black English or African American English or wish to emphasize that this does not include African Americans' regular English use as African American Vernacular English. Theoretically, academics who use alternatives like African American I want to emphasize the African origins of African American speech and its links to languages spoken elsewhere in the Black Diaspora, such as Nigeria and Ghana. But in fact, African American Vernacular English and are pointing to the same set of speech forms. Most authors use would use 'Ebonics' without any ideological or scientific qualification, preferring it to "African American Vernacular English" and other equivalents purely because it is the most widely known public concept right now. To many people for example, Authors claim that certain type of people cannot speak or write English correctly and that people who come to this country need to learn, write, and speak English effectively. Those lamentations are based on the belief that there is a single right way to talk and compose. Why do those authors claim and believe that certain of people cannot speak correctly and write English? Do those people have a different accent than other people who speak English? I assure you they do not, for instance, claiming, "African American language is not good English." Such claims that African American Language does not obey laws, norms, and sound in particular contexts, linguistically speaking, highlights it is not English. However, many people believe that these errors are probably not a big deal. It happens when the speaker does not understand or is not aware of variations between one language and another. For that reason, I do not see why one language is mistaken for another. Also, “African American Vernacular English” is a variation of the English used primarily by black people in the United States. But although it is called African American Vernacular English, it cannot be racially defined since not all black Americans speak this variation of English, and there are also people who are not black Americans, but who can also speak it often even natively. And once again, some people use only some of the features of this variant, Example of words, but it is also hard to describe who really speaks it.  <p> 

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar fashion, I read an article about "African American Language is Not Good English" by Jennifer M. Cunningham. While Jennifer believes that the people of the Southern states’ African American Language influenced American English. She believes that the language of the African American is African but is influenced by the Standard English Language. However, the African American Language is not the same as the English Language; they are both different from the spoken and written discourse. Also, Jennifer M. Cunningham shared her concern in the article entitled, "African American Language is Not Good English." In the article, she claims African American Language combines English vocabulary with African grammar by how the words are ordered and conjugated, which results in different pronunciations of words. Another hypothesis suggests that African American is a language that has developed from a combination of languages that different linguists use in contact backgrounds. It classifies languages, mostly English and Western vocabulary, African grammar, and phonemes from other countries. She claims that the American language is evolved from other countries in which English is considered a Germanic language because of Germanic rules' syntax, as is the situation in American. A clear example to support this is “Linguists define languages according to their grammatical origins, not their vocabulary. For example, English is considered a Germanic language because its grammar follows Germanic rules, even though its vocabulary is largely French and Latin.” (About Who Good Writers Are) </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, most English vocabularies are closely related to French and Latin. I cannot entirely agree with the author Jennifer M. Cunningham because I am among English learners, which is absurd; there are several explanations for it because in French language because I am among English learners, which is absurd; there are several explanations for it because in French language adjectives come after nouns in French, French nouns have genders, they pronounce the words differently than English language, French has many false cognates, also in French “to do” is not an auxiliary verb. Many English learners find that the reason they have difficulty speaking and understanding the language is due to grammar rules: there are so many similarities between American, African American, and even other languages from which English evolved. This is normal for everybody because it is a new thing, and it takes time to learn a new language. It is like applying for a job that requires you to master a particular skill; it is not a disgrace; it is a chance to grow. With more training, the better you become.  In that way, you must spend a lot of time and commitment as an English learner to develop, but you will not master the language.  You can also make grammatical errors and pronounce words and phrases wrongly. These points would prepare a learner to speak correctly with few judgments. An example of me when I learned English in high school, it was difficult for me to understand grammatical errors. However, it was helpful to be patient and spend more time with people who speak English. I've been blamed, but I haven't stopped pushing hard. Whenever I was blamed for mispronunciation, I saw it as an incentive to strengthen the particular word or expression. Therefore, be patient and learn from hatred.<p> 

<h3> Standard English</h3>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these issues are significant, the paper will concentrate on African American Vernacular English and education.  While African American Vernacular English is a language shared by many African Americans, they have a good English standard to move forward in America. Authors believe that African Americans have been and still are, underperforming in reading and have very low academic achievement across the country. After reading "African American Language is Not Good English" article, my knowledge of these articles is that authors believe that most people write and speak in their own words in English, and it is wrong. People assume that the accepted form appeals to the doctrine of the standard language, which is the theory of the Standard Language, that to communicate effectively, all writers and speakers of English must adhere to one set of prevalent language rules that originate from a single dominant discourse, such as standard English. A clear example is "In fact, African American Language follows many grammatical, phonological, and morphological patterns that do not exist in Standard American English." (Bad Ideas) Also, academic writing is an important skill for authors and philosophers to achieve their goals, and it also helps people be better writers.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under those circumstances, we can do academic literature to show and explain the reasoning and argument of authors who believe and understand the basic realities about themselves and others. For example, as to whether people think that the African American language is not good English, I know some authors and people believe that the African American language, such as Nigeria and Ghana, is less rejected as a means of communication than other forms of spoken and written English, broken English means non-standard or wrong, and poor English or slang. They also consider that the African language is difficult to understand because of how the words and their tone are pronounced. As proof to illustrate what authors believe about African American language, which is “Our society perpetuates this stigma, remaining uninformed or misinformed about its linguistic complexity. Understood from a linguistics perspective, African American Language combines an English vocabulary (the words used) with an African grammar (the way the words are ordered and conjugated) and phonology (the way the words are pronounced).” (Bad Ideas) This example shows me that the African American Language has a different way to pronounce words and order words as they speak. Still, I would not think it's a misunderstanding because there are two main hypotheses regarding the origins of the African American Language over and over again. One hypothesis suggests that a dialect with English roots is the African American language. The other hypothesis holds that African American Language is a language that evolves from a combination of languages used for contact by people of diverse linguistic origins and is a distinct language made up of grammatical and phonological rules, often English-language vocabulary words and West African.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, why do people disagree with using the foundation of dialects to teach standard languages? Many people disagree with this approach because of the misconception that African American Vernacular English will be learned in the classroom. Another explanation for criticism of the approach is that some people feel it supports the belief that African Americans are inferior, inadequate, which deepens the impression of impoverished black youth. Also, there is something important that we should know which when a speaker alternates between two or more languages or language variants. In the form of a single conversation, code-switching or language alternation happens in linguistics. Multilingual speakers of more than one language often use features of different languages while communicating with each other.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, Poor attitudes on the part of authors against African American Vernacular English cripple reading in African American students speaking vernacular. When authors meet African American Vernacular English-speaking people with hostile emotions, they frequently initiate miscommunication between them. Also, because authors have pessimistic feelings towards dialect-speaking people, they typically have poor expectations, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Suppose African American Vernacular English was used in the classroom to teach Standard English in the classroom. In that case, the people's reading process should be simpler as the mesosystem's standards became more compatible.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, The author claims that the African American language differs significantly from the standard English language and that it should be distributed from the standard English language, an example about what the author said in his article, which is “ while some African American Language speakers could say She is reading, Standard American English speakers would say She is reading. Both are correct linguistically. There is also a construction that includes the word to be known as chronic be, meaning that if the word be is used in a sentence, an action is consistent or regular. Therefore, she is reading means, in Standard American English, she reads all of the time.” (Bad Ideas) This example shows me that there are no faults in the African American language and the only difference is the pronunciation of words.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My opinion about this particular example is there are no errors in this accent language, and the differences are not a big impact on society. I want to share my personal experience at school when I was 14-year-old. I had difficulty communicating with people, and the main issue is that people understand only a particular accident. My accident was a kind of misunderstanding, which when I try to explain something in the present tense, I start to explain in past tense words. Still, people knew what I mean; meanwhile, this experience plays a significant role in my life and could represent your culture and identity. After a while, I learned many words, and I communicated with people and got many friends who helped me learn English. Again and again, the African American language does not have an impact on standard English</p>
